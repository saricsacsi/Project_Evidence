# Project_Evidence


The basic status:  
 I want to hold the members and the datas in a record.
 Datas:
	- address
	- hash1
	- hash2
	- timelimit

maybe more datas: 
	- status
	- discount
	- etc...

I want to get back the datas from user ID. Update: I use the address to index of the record

Plan: 
- just the members can send ether to the contarct --> made onlyMember modifier
- from the amount of ether i want to calculate the timelimit
- I want to know an address is a member or not? --> isMember:true/false done
- I want to host from the member a signal "OK" 
- delete a record
- know how many memebrs we have
- maybe later change the timelimit
