# Project_Evidence


The contract can register the members with address and 2 different byte32 datas ( in the future e.x. hash or other)

The owner can register the new member ( AddMember) 
Anyone can get back the datas of member with the address
Anyone can check an Address is in or not
Who is a member can send ether to the contarct and from the amount we calculate the time ( to hold the datas in register)
The default time limit is now
The rate is now 1 ether = 1 month

Plan is the future:


- I want to host from the member a signal "OK" 

- delete a record or use " status "

- hold multiple record in connection with one address

- hold other datas in this record what we need
